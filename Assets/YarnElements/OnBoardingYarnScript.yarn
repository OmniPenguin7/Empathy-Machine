Before you start your immersive experience, you must first learn how to use an XR application. #line:InstructorLine2 //lets the player know that they will be going through an onboarding tutorial
Would you like to go through the onboarding tutorial? #line:InstructorLine3 //asks the player if they would like to go through the onboarding tutorial
Move the right controller and press the trigger to choose your answer. #line:ChooseAnswer //instructs the player on how to choose options

The patient you will be roleplaying has these main symptoms; #line:Briefing4
Wounds that are not healing.  #line:Briefing6
Numbness in limbs.  #line:Briefing7
An increase in thirst.  #line:Briefing8
The suitable diagnosis for this level of simulation accuracy is type 2 diabetes. #line:Briefing9
The patient's story will line up with these symptoms. #line:Briefing10
Your job is to ensure the doctor makes the correct diagnosis.#line:Briefing12
For the three stages, you will try and convey the three symptoms; wound healing, numbness and fluid intake. #line:Briefing13
Now, you will enter the simulation. #line:Briefing14
