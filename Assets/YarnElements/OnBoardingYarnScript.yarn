Great job! Now, let’s learn how to interact with objects!

Now you are talking! 
Finally, the last thing you will need to learn is 
how to interact with dialogue. 

A character is waiting outside for you. 
Open the door by interacting with the handle, 
the same way you did with the cube, and go greet them!

Hello there! As you can see, my dialogue is above my head!
Once it disappears, you will be left with two options to choose from. 

Currently, they do not matter, but when you are in the simulation, 
they will affect your outcomes, so choose wisely. 

Do you understand or would you like me to repeat? 

[[Yes]]
[[No]]

Amazing work! 

Now, you will be teleported to learn the diagnosis to keep in mind 
during the simulation, good luck!

The patient you will be roleplaying has these main symptoms; 

Wounds that are not healing.  

Numbness in limbs.  

An increase in thirst.  

The suitable diagnosis for this level of simulation accuracy is diabetes. 
The patient's story will line up with these symptoms. 
Your job is to ensure the doctor makes the correct diagnosis. 
For the three stages, 
you will try and convey the three symptoms; wound healing, numbness and fluid intake. 
Now, you will enter the simulation.
